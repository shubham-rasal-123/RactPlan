# Todays Plan

This project is a responsive and interactive registration form built with [React](https://react.dev/) and styled with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for a modern, mobile-friendly design. The form captures user information with dynamic input fields and provides real-time validation using [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) and React states. Leveraging [React-DOM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dom) for rendering, and [React-Scripts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-scripts) for streamlined development, the project offers a fast, efficient development environment. [Web Vitals](https://www.npmjs.com/package/web-vitals) is included for performance monitoring, ensuring optimal user experience. This registration form is ideal for learning component-based design, state management, and responsive UI building in React.
